I am learning C on Youtube hoping to come out with the best result possible.

I am learning most things using the youtube channel "Jenny's Lecture"

This repository is created by me to keep practicing stuffs I learn on the go aside using ALX.

I am going to be playing more on this repository till i can finally connect the dots.

This repository is what i ill tag as "My days of Humble Beginning"

"You can now go back to see if I learned a lot or I gave up".

If I learned a lot; Interesting and use that to motivate yourself (as a beginner)

If I gave up, I'm a sore Loser who probably thinks he's smart with computer but not. Don't give up too ok. :)
